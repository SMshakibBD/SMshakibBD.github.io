		<h3>Why did you choose to study CSE ?</h3>	

		<b>Basically</b>, I watch lots of tv series based on science fiction & thriller which really encourages and stimulates me. I am literally movie freak. There is no single day that i dont watch series/movies. I have kept specific day time for watching movies.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		And we all know that everything is being technology based. Technology has made the world better, faster and more connected.The most important aspect of CSE is problem solving, an essential skill for life. So there's a change to show your creativity.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		To be frankly i wanted to be a ethical hacker(white hat hacker). So thats why i thought if i choose cse to study it will be helpful to reach my goal. Thats why now i am here and i think i am on my track.
